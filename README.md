### Run project using Docker Image


### Run project from scratch 

If you want to develop the project from scratch, you need to create a virtual envioronment for each microservice and install the requirements. When you are done creating all virtual envs and installing the requirements, you can start the project by running

```bash
bash start.sh
```

This command will activate each microservice independently and will run all projects.
